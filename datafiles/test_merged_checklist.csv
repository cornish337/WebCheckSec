Modern best practice says periodic password expiration often harms security (users choose weaker variants). Instead, focus on other controls (breach detection, MFA). So this requirement means the app should not implement mandatory periodic rotations or overly strict password history reuse rules.","Manual steps: Identify if the application has an expiration policy: this might be in the security settings or terms. Sometimes during initial login or in user profile it might say 'Password expires in X days'. If testable, create a user and see if there's any indication of expiration (often not easily testable in short-term).; If you have admin access or config access in a test environment, check if password expiration settings are turned on. Otherwise, it’s likely a policy question: ask the devs or read documentation.; For password history, attempt to reuse an old password when changing: e.g., change password from A to B, then later try changing back to A. If the system says 'you cannot reuse recent passwords', that indicates a history enforcement. ASVS discourages forcing a long history. A short history (like disallow immediate reuse of last password) might be okay in practice, but ASVS ideally says not to enforce history at all, aside from not reusing the current one. Tools: Application admin panel or config dump, Interview/QA Combo: This often comes up in a **Policy Review Pack** rather than active exploit pack. It pairs with the complexity rule check because both are about modern password policy.

If paste is blocked, either nothing will happen or perhaps an alert will show. Some sites use JavaScript to prevent paste events.; If paste is blocked, open browser dev tools and inspect the input element: look for attributes like `onpaste=""return false""` or scripts that attach an event handler to prevent pasting. That confirms an intentional block.; Test multiple browsers if you suspect it: occasionally one browser might enforce it differently (but usually it's a simple JS that affects all).

Essentially: do not rely solely on SMS or email as primary auth credentials; use them in MFA context only.","Manual steps: Identify how the application’s authentication works: does it offer MFA via SMS or email code? Or does it use SMS/email as primary login (some apps send a magic link via email to log in – that’s passwordless via email, which is borderline here).; If SMS/email is used for MFA, ensure that it’s indeed a second step after password, not the only thing. For instance, check that the user still has a password or primary factor and that SMS code is an additional verification.; If the app allows login by just an email link (magic link) or just an SMS code (some phone apps do that), note that as violating this requirement for sensitive contexts. However, magic links are increasingly common – ASVS might consider those okay if properly implemented (they’re akin to a token delivered out-of-band).

If file upload functionality doesn’t enforce a reasonable max file size, an attacker could upload an extremely large file to consume space or memory.","Manual steps: If the application documentation/UI mentions a max file size (e.g., 'Max 5MB'), attempt to upload a file larger than that (say 2x the limit). Observe if the app rejects it (with an error) or if it tries to accept it (progress bar, then maybe fails later or succeeds). If it accepts way beyond advertised limit, that’s an issue.; If no stated limit, try progressively larger files: e.g., 1MB, 10MB, 50MB, etc., to find if a limit exists. Keep an eye on upload time and server response. If a 100MB file uploads and you get a success, likely no proper limit.; Monitor application response: ideally, the server should respond with HTTP 413 (Entity Too Large) or a friendly error if limit exceeded. If it doesn’t, maybe the limit is only client-side (like HTML file input 'max' attribute) – try bypassing by using an intercepting proxy to send a larger payload. Tools: Curl, Burp Suite (Intruder/Payload) Combo: This ties with **DoS & Abuse Pack**: test not only file size but also multiple files (if allowed concurrently) to see if combined volume is limited. And with zip bomb test in next item to gauge protections.","- **OWASP Cheat Sheet** – “Set a file size limit” for uploads:contentReference[oaicite:122]{index=122}:contentReference[oaicite:123]{index=123}.

So lack of type validation is a vulnerability.","Manual steps: Review what file types are expected. If it’s an image upload feature, likely only images should be allowed. Try uploading a file with a different extension (e.g., a `.jsp` or `.php` disguised maybe by changing extension to `.jpg`). Does the app block it or accept it?; Test the MIME type: some apps validate by extension only. Use a tool or proxy to change the Content-Type header of the upload to something incorrect or to none and see if it matters. Also, try renaming an executable file to have an allowed extension and see if the content sniffs through. E.g., rename a `.exe` to `.png` and attempt upload – does the app detect by scanning content or just trust the extension?; If possible, after upload, see how the app treats the file: if you managed to upload an HTML or JS file, can you retrieve it via the app?
