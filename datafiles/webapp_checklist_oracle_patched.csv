This test verifies that common vulnerabilities and misconfigurations (e.g., default credentials, known CVEs, open directories) are checked early using automated tools. It’s important because automation can catch low-hanging fruit and provide broad coverage – things an attacker would easily find – ensuring no basic weakness is overlooked before deeper manual testing.

Todo: Description","- **Automated Scanners**: Use tools like **OWASP ZAP (Baseline scan)** or **Nikto** to scan for common web server issues and known vulnerabilities. These tools will crawl the site and report issues like server version disclosures, directory indexing, or default files.
- **Nuclei**: Run a set of **Nuclei** templates for known vulnerabilities/misconfigurations. Nuclei has templates for default admin pages, config leaks, CVE-specific checks, etc., which can be launched in one go to flag any low-hanging issues.
- **Burp Suite (Automated)**: Burp’s **Active Scanner** or extensions (like Active Scan++ or task scheduler) can perform an initial probe for common vulnerabilities (SQLi, XSS, etc.) across all discovered pages. Combine this with Burp’s **Spider** to ensure all endpoints are covered.
- These automated tasks can be orchestrated via a script or tool suite (sometimes referred to as a “ranger” automation script) to run sequentially. The results give a broad overview that guides where to do focused manual testing next. Always review findings manually to weed out false positives.

Todo: Tools","- **OWASP WSTG** – *Information Gathering* and *Configuration Management Testing* sections stress running automated discovery and vulnerability scans early. They outline using scanners to map the application and catch obvious misconfigurations.
- **NIST SP 800-115** – The NIST security testing guide advises using automated **vulnerability scanners** in the assessment’s discovery phase to quickly enumerate hosts, services, and known vulnerabilities. This ensures comprehensive coverage of common issues before manual testing.

Todo: Links","Applicable to virtually all web apps. Only mark N/A if the environment strictly forbids automation (e.g., a very sensitive app where scanning is not allowed) or if the scope is so limited (a simple static page) that an automated scan would be redundant. In standard engagements, running baseline automation is always recommended to uncover easy-to-find issues. Even single-page apps or APIs benefit from automation to ensure no well-known weakness is missed.

"GENERAL","Baseline checks and enumeration","Directory, header, file and parameter enumeration","FALSE","Todo: Subtask","FALSE","FALSE","","Systematically discover hidden or unreferenced content and inputs in the application. This includes enumerating directories/files (to find pages or data not linked in the UI), examining HTTP headers (for insights or security settings), and finding HTTP parameters (including ones not exposed by the UI). This matters because sensitive information or functionalities (admin pages, backup files, debug endpoints, or optional parameters) are often accessible if one knows where to look – and attackers will try to find these. By enumerating these, we ensure the app isn’t exposing anything unintended that could lead to compromise.

Todo: Description","- **Directory/File Brute-Forcing**: Use tools like **ffuf**, **Gobuster**, or **Dirbuster** with common wordlists (e.g., SecLists) to find hidden directories and files. For example, try enumerating `/admin`, `/backup/`, `.git/`, or files like *config.php*, *backup.zip*. These tools send a high volume of requests with different filenames and analyze which ones return valid responses.
- **Parameter Discovery**: Utilize a Burp Suite extension like **ParamMiner** to guess hidden HTTP parameters. This involves sending requests with common parameter names (like `?debug=true` or `X-Original-URL`) and seeing if the application responds differently. Burp Intruder can also test parameter fuzzing by inserting payloads in parameter names as well as values to see undisclosed functionality.
- **HTTP Headers Inspection**: Intercept and review HTTP response headers using Burp or **OWASP ZAP**. Look for any unusual headers (e.g., `X-Debug-Info`, `X-Version`), which might reveal internal info or debugging is enabled. Also check standard security headers here (like CSP, HSTS) – their presence or absence can be noted for other tests. For request headers, you can try adding headers like `X-Forwarded-For` or `X-Originating-IP` to probe if the app trusts them (which might surface in logs or behavior).
- **Infrastructure Enumeration**: If applicable, use tools like **Nmap** (with http-enum or http-index scripts) to enumerate well-known files and directories. This can supplement web-specific tools by discovering server config files or default pages.
- Many of these tests can be grouped: e.g., run a dir brute-force that finds an `/api/` directory, then enumerate parameters on its endpoints. By combining results (files found, parameters found), you build a more complete attack surface map.

Todo: Tools","- **OWASP WSTG** – *Content Discovery* and *File/Directory Enumeration* (WSTG-INFO-*** and WSTG-CONFIG-***): Emphasize trying common filenames, backup extensions, and unlinked pages. Also discusses reviewing server headers and responses for hidden clues.
- **OWASP Cheat Sheet – Content Discovery**: Provides techniques and common wordlists for finding hidden files and parameters (e.g., using robots.txt clues, common admin paths).
- **PTES (Pre-Test Phase)** – Recommends comprehensive enumeration of application entry points (URLs, parameters) as a foundation for later testing, aligning with this step of gathering all potential targets.

Todo: Links","Nearly always relevant. Only not applicable if the application is extremely minimal (a single static page with no inputs) – and even then, checking for server headers and any accessible files is quick. In most cases, dynamic apps, APIs, and even static file servers may have hidden paths or parameters. This should be done unless it’s absolutely certain there are no hidden elements (which is rare without testing). If the engagement scope excludes active probing or if credentials are needed to see anything (and none are provided), then broad enumeration might be limited, but generally some form of this test applies to every assessment.

This means the organization has processes to consider security early (not just as an afterthought). A security-aware SDLC helps catch design flaws and vulnerabilities before the app goes live. Without it, critical issues might slip in due to lack of threat modeling, code review, or security testing during development, increasing the likelihood of vulnerabilities in the deployed application.

Todo: Description","- **Process Review & Interviews**: This is more of a procedural check. Interview developers or project managers to confirm if there are security checkpoints (e.g., threat modeling sessions during design, code review with security in mind, use of SAST/DAST tools during coding/testing). Request any SDLC documentation or policies that outline secure coding guidelines and security requirements in user stories.
- **Documentation Audit**: Examine artifacts like design documents or requirement backlogs for evidence of security considerations (e.g., “user password must be stored hashed with Bcrypt” in requirements). The presence of security user stories or abuse cases is a positive sign.
- **Tool Integration**: Check if the project uses tools like **GitHub/GitLab CI security scans**, **OWASP dependency-check** for third-party libraries, or if they have a **security champion** role. The existence of these tools in the build pipeline indicates security is built-in at each stage.

Effective threat modeling ensures security is considered at the design phase – identifying risky components or abuse cases early. Without it, new features might introduce vulnerabilities because developers didn’t anticipate how an attacker might target them or what new trust boundaries are created.

Todo: Description","- **Interview & Process Check**: Ask the development team how they incorporate threat modeling. Do they use frameworks like **STRIDE** or **PASTA** during design meetings? Evidence could be in design documents listing threats/mitigations or tickets in the backlog for threat model reviews.
- **Examine Artifacts**: If threat models exist, review them. These might be data flow diagrams (DFDs) with annotations of threats, or a list of identified threats per feature and how they were addressed. The presence of these documents for each significant change or feature is a good sign.
- **Tools for Threat Modeling**: Some teams use tools like **OWASP Threat Dragon** or Microsoft’s **Threat Modeling Tool**. Inquire if such tools are used and if outputs (threat lists) are stored. While not hands-on “tools” for a tester, seeing their output or usage is part of verifying this requirement.
- **Sprint Ceremonies**: If possible, sit in (or get minutes from) a sprint planning meeting to see if security questions are raised for each user story (e.g., “What’s the worst that could happen if this feature is abused?”). This indicates threat modeling thinking is embedded in planning.

Todo: Tools","- **OWASP ASVS 1.1** – Highlights threat modeling as a control (V1.1.2: “Verify that threat modeling is performed regularly for critical or new functionality”). ASVS requires that design changes undergo a security review, essentially what threat modeling provides.

Todo: Links","Relevant for projects using iterative development (sprints) or any process where features change over time. If an application is in maintenance with no new features and threat modeling was done once initially, ongoing threat modeling for each change might be N/A (because no new design changes).

In practice, this means that acceptance criteria for features include what users *should not* be able to do, not just the positive functionality. For example, a story “User can edit their profile” should include the caveat “and not be able to edit others’ profiles.” This matters because it embeds security and access control into the development process – developers and testers will then naturally test those constraints. If security constraints aren’t documented in user stories, there’s a risk that devs might implement a feature without proper access checks or other security considerations, since it wasn’t clearly defined as part of the requirement.

Todo: Description","- **Backlog Review**: Look at the project’s issue tracker or story backlog (e.g., in JIRA, Trello). Check a sample of user stories or requirements for explicit security-related acceptance criteria (like authorization rules, data validation rules). For instance, a story might say “As an admin, I can delete any user’s post, but regular users can only delete their own posts.” The second clause is the security constraint.
- **Interview**: Ask product owners or developers how they capture security in requirements. Do they use misuse cases or abuse stories (like “As an attacker, I should not be able to X”)? Their approach will indicate if it’s systematic or ad-hoc.
- **Review Test Cases**: If QA has test cases for user stories, see if negative tests are included (e.g., test that user A cannot access user B’s data). The presence of these implies the story had that constraint defined from the start.
- There isn’t a specific automation tool for this verification; it’s more about process. However, traceability tools in ALM (Application Lifecycle Management) software can show if each story has a linked security requirement or not. Utilizing those, you could gauge coverage (e.g., how many stories have a “Security” tag or sub-task).

Essentially, the design should show where data transitions from one trust context to another (e.g., from the internet into the internal network, or from an authenticated user zone to an admin zone) and explain how those boundaries are protected. This matters because unclear or undocumented trust boundaries often lead to assumptions that attackers exploit – for example, if it’s not documented that “the API gateway is a trust boundary,” developers might not validate input assuming some upstream component did. Well-defined boundaries help ensure proper controls (like authentication, encryption, validation) are in place whenever data or commands cross into a more trusted zone.

Todo: Description","- **Architecture Diagram Review**: Obtain network and application architecture diagrams. Look for annotations or demarcations like firewalls, tiers (web, app, DB), and any external integrations. Verify that each line crossing from one component to another is recognized as a potential trust boundary. For instance, a call from the web server to the database crosses a boundary where input should be sanitized and authenticated. If diagrams aren’t annotated, that might indicate this hasn’t been documented.
- **Threat Model Documents**: If threat modeling is done (from a previous item), those often explicitly call out trust boundaries. Check if the threat model lists boundaries and the rationale for trust decisions (e.g., “Module A and Module B run under different privileges, so their interface is a trust boundary – input is validated and authenticated here”).
- **Interviews**: Ask architects or senior developers to describe the trust boundaries. A justified trust boundary means they can explain why, say, a separate microservice is or isn’t in the same trust domain. For example, *“We consider the client browser to server connection a trust boundary – hence we enforce TLS and input validation at that point”*.
- No automated tool will “detect” trust boundaries; this is a design verification. However, using a checklist (like OWASP Architectural Review checklist) can ensure you ask about typical boundaries: user-to-app, app-to-database, app-to-external system, etc., and see if each is documented and has controls.

Todo: Tools","- **OWASP ASVS 1.1.4** – Requires that architecture documentation includes delineation of trust boundaries. It expects that each trust boundary is identified and security controls are in place at those boundaries.

- **NIST SP 800-53 (SA-17)** – The control “Security Architecture” in NIST 800-53 asks for an architecture that includes considerations of trust (like separating different domains and documenting interactions). While more high-level, it aligns with marking and justifying trust boundaries in system docs.

Todo: Links","Relevant for any non-trivial application. Even simple web apps have at least one trust boundary (user vs server). This would be N/A only if no architecture documentation exists and the test scope doesn’t allow architectural analysis (pure black-box with zero design insight). In a typical architecture review or white-box pentest, you should evaluate this. If the application is extremely simple (e.g., static site with no back-end logic), trust boundaries are minimal (client vs server), but still should be noted. Otherwise, assume it applies.

This is about defense in depth: if an attacker compromises the application, using a low-privilege OS account limits the damage (the attacker can’t immediately take over the whole server or OS). Conversely, if the app runs as admin/root, any code execution or directory traversal becomes far more severe. Verifying this means checking deployment configurations and processes to see that accounts like *www-data*, *tomcat*, or custom least-privileged users are used for the app service.

Todo: Description","- **Configuration Inspection**: If you have access to the server (during a config review phase), check the user under which the application process is running. On Linux, this might mean running `ps -ef` and seeing that the web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx, Tomcat) is running as a limited user (not root). For Windows, ensure services run as NetworkService or a dedicated low-priv user, not as LocalSystem unless absolutely necessary.
- **File/Process Access Tests**: Even in a black-box test, you might glean some info. For example, attempt to access a protected file via the app (like read `/etc/shadow` on Linux or `C:\Windows\System32\...` on Windows through a file access vulnerability). If the application user is low privilege, direct access will be denied. This is more of an indirect test by probing for common protected resources (though this blurs into vulnerability testing, not just architecture).
- **Review Deployment Scripts or Dockerfiles**: If the app is containerized or has infrastructure as code, inspect those. Dockerfiles, for instance, should use a non-root user (`USER appuser`). Kubernetes manifests should not set privileged pods and should run as specific user IDs. Checking these configurations verifies enforcement of least privilege at runtime.
- **Ask the DevOps/Engineers**: Sometimes the quickest way – inquire which OS user the app runs under and what privileges it has. Verify that answer by cross-checking with documentation or a quick runtime test as above.

Todo: Tools","- **OWASP ASVS 1.2.1** – States that all components should run with minimal necessary privileges, referencing that applications shouldn’t run as root/admin. It’s an explicit requirement to use low-privilege accounts.
- **OWASP Server Security Configuration Guide** – Recommends configuring web and application servers to use dedicated service accounts with restricted permissions (no shell login, limited folder access).
- **NIST SP 800-53 (CM-6 Least Functionality)** – Although general, it implies that systems should be configured to provide only essential capabilities and restrict privileges; running services under least privilege accounts is part of that practice.

For example, if the web front-end calls a backend API or database, does that API require a key, token, or certificate from the caller? This prevents an attacker who gains network access from impersonating a service. It’s important because as applications get split into services, trust should not be implicit; otherwise, a compromised or rogue service (or an external attacker) could call internal APIs without restriction if they aren’t verifying identities.

Todo: Description","- **Architecture Diagram & Config Review**: Identify all the inter-component communications (web server to app server, app server to database, microservice A to B, etc.). For each, determine what authentication mechanism is in place. This could be checking API gateway configs (are services using mutual TLS with certificates? Are they passing JWTs or API keys on internal calls?). Configuration files (like cloud gateway settings or Docker/Kubernetes secrets) may reveal internal auth tokens or certificates in use.
- **Traffic Analysis**: If you can observe internal traffic (in a test environment), use a tool like **Wireshark** or a **proxy** between services to capture communications. Verify that credentials or tokens are being used. For instance, when Service A calls Service B, do you see an Authorization header or a client certificate being presented? If internal APIs are called over plain protocols with no auth, that’s a finding.
- **Simulated Calls**: If you have the network access in a test environment, try to directly call an internal service endpoint without credentials. For example, call an internal API URL that the front-end would call, but do it manually without the expected token. If the request succeeds or you can perform actions, that indicates missing internal authentication. (This must be done carefully and usually only in a controlled environment.)
- **Review Documentation/Policies**: Sometimes architecture docs or security policies state that “all service-to-service calls must be mutually authenticated”. Cross-check such statements with actual implementation evidence (certs, tokens in config).

Todo: Tools","- **OWASP ASVS 1.2.2** – Requires that all communications between components are authenticated (and secured). This maps exactly to ensuring microservice/API calls aren’t implicitly trusted.

- **NIST Zero Trust Architecture (NIST SP 800-207)** – Though broad, it advocates that no network segment should be inherently trusted. Each request, even internal, should be authenticated and authorized. This underpins the need for inter-component authentication.

Todo: Links","Applicable to multi-tier or microservice architectures. In a monolithic app where everything runs in one process, it’s less directly relevant (though the database authentication still applies – the app should auth to the DB).

Examples: using a central authentication service (like LDAP/OAuth or a single sign-on provider) rather than separate login logic in each module, or a unified access control library that all components call. Centralized controls (for auth, access control, input validation, etc.) help maintain consistency and are less prone to human error. If every developer writes their own security check, some part of the app might do it incorrectly. A central, well-vetted control reduces that risk and makes updates easier (fix in one place).

Todo: Description","- **Architecture Review**: Identify security functions like authentication, authorization, input sanitization, logging, etc., and see if the design uses centralized services/libraries for these. For instance, verify that all modules use a common auth service or API gateway for login. If different parts of the app have separate login pages or separate user stores, that’s a red flag.
- **Code Review**: If available, scan the codebase for multiple implementations of the same thing. E.g., search for password validation logic in multiple modules – ideally, there should be one module or service responsible for that. Tools like **grep** or static analysis can find duplicates. If you find hard-coded security decisions scattered around (like various SQL queries checking roles), that might indicate no central enforcement point.
- **Interviews**: Ask developers/architects if they use frameworks or centralized services: *“Do you use a single sign-on or centralized user identity service?”*, *“Is there a global access control mechanism (like an API gateway or middleware) that every request goes through?”*. Their answers will reveal if security is consistently applied or if it’s siloed.
- **Testing**: It’s a bit conceptual, but consider a scenario: if you bypass one component’s security (like calling a backend API directly), would a central control still enforce rules? For example, if an API gateway is the centralized control, calling the microservice directly (bypassing the gateway) should fail. If it doesn’t, that means security checks were not centralized at the gateway and had to be done individually (and one was missed). This kind of test can show whether central controls are truly in place.

Todo: Tools","- **OWASP ASVS 1.2.3** – Advises that security controls (like authentication, access control, input validation) be implemented in a centralized way. The idea is one primary location or service for each control.
- **OWASP Top 10: A5-Security Misconfiguration** – One cause of misconfig is not having centralized config or controls, leading to inconsistent settings. Centralizing security controls helps avoid misconfiguration and omissions in some parts of the app.
- **PTES Architectural Review** – The Penetration Testing Execution Standard suggests reviewing whether an application uses a common security framework.

This could be an internal policy document or an industry standard (like CERT Java secure coding or OWASP Secure Coding Guidelines). The presence of such a checklist/policy means the organization has identified common security pitfalls and best practices and expects developers to adhere to them. It matters because without guidance, developers might unintentionally introduce vulnerabilities – a checklist institutionalizes lessons learned and known good practices (e.g., “Never store passwords in plaintext”, “Use parameterized queries for DB access”, etc.).

Todo: Description","- **Policy Documentation Review**: Request the secure coding guidelines or policies from the organization. Evaluate if it covers relevant areas (authentication, access control, error handling, etc.) and if it’s up-to-date. A good checklist might map to OWASP ASVS or similar standards.
- **Developer Interviews/Survey**: Ask a few developers if they are aware of a secure coding policy and where to find it. If they can’t, that’s a sign it exists only on paper or not at all. If they can, ask if it’s part of their code review checklist or QA.
- **Code Review for Consistency**: If secure coding guidelines exist, their effect should be visible in code. For instance, if the policy says “use prepared statements for SQL”, you should not find raw string concatenation SQL queries in the code. By sampling the codebase for such patterns, you can gauge adherence and indirectly the presence of guidelines. Static analysis tools can help: run a scan (like **Semgrep** or **SonarQube**) for obvious insecure patterns. If many are present, either no checklist exists or it’s not followed.
- **Build Pipeline Integration**: Check if the checklist’s rules are enforced via tools (e.g., linters or QA gates).

In practice, this means checks like “is user X allowed to do action Y?” happen on the server (or a centralized authorization service) that cannot be bypassed, as opposed to only in the UI or a mobile app. It also means using consistent enforcement points – for example, a middleware or gateway through which all requests pass and get authorized. This matters because if enforcement is done in an untrusted environment (like client-side JavaScript or a browser), attackers can manipulate it. And if enforcement is scattered (not centralized), some endpoints might be forgotten, leading to authorization bypasses.

Todo: Description","- **Design Review**: Identify how and where the app performs authorization. Does the architecture include an API gateway or a central authZ service (like OAuth2 resource server, or a policy engine like OPA)? If yes, verify that all critical requests funnel through it. If some components talk to each other directly without going through the gateway, that’s a spot to examine further.
- **Code/Config Inspection**: If you can review code, look for a common filter or interceptor that checks permissions on every request (e.g., a servlet filter in Java, or a global `@Authorize` annotation usage in controllers). The presence of a global access control mechanism indicates a central enforcement. Conversely, if each function manually implements access checks, there’s risk one is missed. Static analysis can sometimes find endpoints with no auth checks if most have one.
- **Testing by Bypassing UI**: Try direct requests that mimic higher-privilege actions to see if server-side enforcement catches it. For example, if there’s an admin function not exposed in the UI for a normal user, directly call the admin API endpoint as a normal user. A proper enforcement point (like an access gateway) should reject it. If it succeeds, access control may only be enforced in the client (which is a flaw).
- **Configuration Review**: For apps using external auth servers (like AWS Cognito, Okta, etc.), ensure that resource policies or gateway configs exist. For instance, check that your API Gateway has authorization enabled for each route. This is a kind of deployment check ensuring every entry point is covered by an auth policy.

Todo: Tools","- **OWASP ASVS 1.3.1** – Requires that trusted enforcement points (like server-side or centralized components) are used for access control:contentReference[oaicite:39]{index=39}. It explicitly says to enforce access control in trusted locations, not on the client.
- **OWASP WSTG – Authorization Testing**: The guide reiterates that one should test for enforcement on the server. Tests like *“Bypassing Authorization Schema”* (WSTG-ATHZ-02) assume there is a central check and we verify it’s in place by attempting to bypass it.
- **CWE-602 (Client-Side Enforcement of Server-Side Security)** – This CWE highlights the mistake of enforcing security on the client side. The resolution is to do it on the trusted server side. It underpins why this check is important – to avoid CWE-602 scenarios.

"Architecture, Design and Threat Modeling Requirements (V1)","Access Control Architecture Requirements","Verify chosen control solution is flexible to meet application requirements","FALSE","Todo: Subtask","FALSE","TRUE","1.4.2","Confirm that the access control mechanism or framework in use is flexible enough to express the app’s permission rules without developers resorting to ad-hoc workarounds. A flexible solution might mean a roles and permissions system that supports the complex rules the app needs (hierarchical roles, attribute-based access control, etc.). If the solution is too simplistic or rigid, developers might implement bypasses or duplicate checks to achieve what they need, which can introduce mistakes. Essentially, the access control system should align well with business requirements – e.g., if the app needs per-record ownership permissions, the chosen system should handle that via something like ABAC or contextual checks. Verifying this ensures the access control architecture will actually be used correctly everywhere, rather than circumvented in some parts of the code.

Todo: Description","- **Requirements to Control Mapping**: Enumerate the types of access rules in the application (for instance: “Managers can approve expenses up to $1000”, “Users can only see their own orders unless they have role X”). Then examine the access control framework (or service) in place. Does it support rules of that nature? For example, if using a role-based system, can it easily express row-level ownership restrictions? If not, developers might implement those checks manually elsewhere – find those spots.
- **Code Review**: Look for instances where developers wrote custom access logic rather than using the central system. E.g., if the app uses a standard @RoleAllowed annotation mostly, but you find functions with manual role checks (`if(user.role == 'ADMIN')` in code), that could indicate the standard solution didn’t cover that scenario. Each custom check is a potential flaw. Static analysis or grep can find such patterns.
- **Developer Interviews**: Ask if any security requirements were hard to implement with the current ACL (Access Control List)/RBAC system. If they mention “Oh, the framework couldn’t do X so we had to do Y ourselves,” that points to inflexibility. Also ask if they maintain permissions in config or code and whether it’s cumbersome – if yes, they might bypass it for expediency.
- **Policy Management Interface**: If the solution has a UI or config for managing permissions (like a central policy server), review how granular it is. A too-simplistic scheme (only high-level roles, no context of data) may not meet fine-grained needs. Check if there are “exceptions” or special-case code for specific scenarios; lots of exceptions can mean the system wasn’t a great fit.

Todo: Tools","- **OWASP ASVS 1.3.2** – Implies that access control models should be capable of enforcing business rules (if a chosen model is too limited, it’s a design issue). While ASVS doesn’t explicitly say “flexible,” it does require that access control is sufficient and used uniformly.
- **NIST SP 800-162 (Guide to ABAC)** – Discusses choosing attribute-based access control for complex policy requirements. The essence is matching the complexity of rules with the right framework. If an app’s needs are complex and ABAC is warranted, using a simple RBAC might fail. This NIST guide helps identify the right model for the requirements.
- **OWASP Top 10 – A5 Broken Access Control**: Many examples of broken access control come from developers trying to implement checks outside a consistent framework (because the framework wasn’t fitting). The Top 10 commentary suggests using tested, appropriate access control mechanisms to avoid such gaps.

Todo: Links","This is a bit abstract, but applies to systems with non-trivial access rules. Simpler apps (e.g., just admin vs user) likely any standard solution fits, so flexibility isn’t a big concern. It becomes crucial when business rules are complex. Mark N/A if the access control requirements are very basic (so flexibility is moot) or if the app doesn’t really have roles/permissions (everything public or single-user app). Otherwise, especially in enterprise apps, ensure the access control design matches needs.

"Architecture, Design and Threat Modeling Requirements (V1)","Access Control Architecture Requirements","Verify enforcement of principle of least privilege in functions, data files etc","FALSE","Todo: Subtask","FALSE","TRUE","1.4.3","Check that throughout the application, users (or processes) only have the minimum access rights necessary to perform their tasks – no more. This principle of least privilege should be evident in how functions are exposed (e.g., regular users shouldn’t see admin functionalities), how data is segmented (a user can only access their own records by design), and how file access is handled (the app only can read/write files it absolutely needs). The goal is to limit potential damage if a user account or component is compromised. If this principle isn’t enforced, a low-privileged user might find ways (via direct object references, API calls, etc.) to perform unauthorized actions or read sensitive data, simply because the system didn’t restrict it.

Todo: Description","- **Authorization Matrix**: Build or obtain a matrix of roles vs. features/data. Verify that the application’s UI and API adhere to this matrix (least privilege means most boxes in such a matrix are “No Access” except the minimal necessary ones). If no formal matrix exists, deduce one from requirements and test against it.
- **Functional Testing**: As a lower-privileged user, attempt to perform actions reserved for higher roles (or system admins). For example, try accessing an admin-only URL or functionality. Use a tool like **Burp** to modify requests (change your role or user ID in requests) to see if the server side prevents it. E.g., attempt to retrieve someone else’s data by changing an identifier. Proper least privilege enforcement will result in an access denied or not found.
- **File System Checks**: If you can access the server or if the app deals with file paths, verify that it doesn’t have access beyond what it needs. For instance, if the app should only serve images from `/app/uploads/`, try requesting `../` paths to see if it can read other files – it should be restricted (this crosses into path traversal testing, which is related). Also ensure any system accounts (from earlier check) have limited directory permissions on the OS.
- **Code Review**: Look at how data access is implemented. If the code retrieves data without scoping by the current user or role (e.g., a query like `SELECT * FROM records` without a `WHERE user_id = ?`), that violates least privilege on data. Static analysis or manual review can catch missing filters in data queries that should enforce ownership.

Todo: Tools","- **OWASP ASVS 1.3.3** – Focuses on least privilege enforcement for users and services. It says that users should only have access to what they require (no excessive privileges), implying checks at every layer to prevent privilege escalation.
- **OWASP Top 10 – Broken Access Control**: Most broken access control issues (like IDOR, privilege escalation) are a result of not properly implementing least privilege. For instance, Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) occur when the app fails to enforce that users can only access their own objects.
- **Principle of Least Privilege (NIST)** – NIST guidelines repeatedly mention POLP in various contexts (user accounts, service accounts, firewall rules). NIST SP 800-53 has multiple controls (AC-6 Least Privilege, etc.) demanding that systems restrict permissions to the minimum necessary – reflecting this principle in application design too.

Todo: Links","Always applicable where there are multiple user roles or sensitive operations. If the application has a single user or no concept of roles (rare in multi-user systems), this might be less of a concern in that narrow sense, but even processes on the backend still should have least privilege. Generally, any system beyond trivial “one user does everything” should enforce least privilege and thus should be verified.

See if server rejects it or if it goes through (if it goes through, server isn't enforcing).; If no explicit UI limit, attempt to upload files in quick succession. For example, upload 10 or 20 small files rapidly (this can be manual rapid clicks or automated). Observe if at some point you're blocked or if performance degrades. Also look for any error like 'too many uploads' or a temporary ban.; If the app has an account storage quota (like max X MB or Y files per user), try to exceed it.

If there’s no validation, attackers could upload disallowed or dangerous file types (like scripts, executables) possibly leading to security issues (like stored XSS if an HTML is served, or malware on download). So lack of type validation is a vulnerability.","Manual steps: Review what file types are expected. If it’s an image upload feature, likely only images should be allowed. Try uploading a file with a different extension (e.g., a `.jsp` or `.php` disguised maybe by changing extension to `.jpg`). Does the app block it or accept it?; Test the MIME type: some apps validate by extension only. Use a tool or proxy to change the Content-Type header of the upload to something incorrect or to none and see if it matters. Also, try renaming an executable file to have an allowed extension and see if the content sniffs through. E.g., rename a `.exe` to `.png` and attempt upload – does the app detect by scanning content or just trust the extension?; If possible, after upload, see how the app treats the file: if you managed to upload an HTML or JS file, can you retrieve it via the app? If yes and it’s served as HTML, that’s a problem (XSS or defacement potential). A well-configured server might force download or sanitize these, but the fact it got stored is already not ideal. Tools: Burp (manual request edit), OWASP ZAP (Active scan with file upload addon) Combo: Combine with **Malicious File Pack**: Alongside type testing, you likely also test content (like embedding scripts) and path traversal.

This is a step further than just reading (traversal) – it’s about executing or inserting the content into output as code.","Manual steps: LFI typically concerns dynamic file execution. If the app has a parameter like `page=home` that it includes as `home.jsp` or `home.php` on server, try tampering: e.g., `page=../../../../etc/passwd%00` (the %00 null byte trick is for older PHP to terminate string). If code execution context, this might just show file content or error out in an interesting way.; Try to include known application files: for instance, `page=index.php` (the main script) or any file that you know exists on server. See if its content appears (which it shouldn't) or if the app outputs errors with code fragments. That indicates LFI.; If a file you include has some exploitable content (like, including a log file that contains attacker-controlled data can lead to RCE), it's complex but possible. For testing, see if you can get the app to include itself or a config file with credentials (that might print DB passwords). Tools: Burp/ZAP Intruder (same as traversal), lfimap or commix specialized tools Combo: Pairs with traversal tests. Essentially, if traversal is possible and the file gets executed or included in page output, it's LFI.

Remote File Inclusion (RFI) is when an app accepts a URL (like `http://evil.com/shell.php`) and includes it as code or data. This can lead to immediate server compromise (if code is included) or data leakage. Typically an issue in languages like PHP with `allow_url_include` or poorly handled URL fetch functionality.","Manual steps: Find any functionality that might accept a URL or domain from user. For example, an app might have a parameter `?feedUrl=http://example.com/feed.xml` to import something, or a debug endpoint where you provide a URL to fetch data.; Try supplying a URL to a server you control (like a request bin or your own web server) to see if the app attempts to fetch it. If it does, that's a SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery) which is related. But RFI specifically is about including remote content as code – hard to detect externally unless error messages or results show it.; For PHP, test `page=http://yourserver/shell.txt` (with shell.txt containing something benign or distinctive). If the app is vulnerable, it might execute or show the content of that file. Tools: Burp Collaborator, Request Bin / Netcat Combo: This is basically SSRF but targeted at file includes. Can be bundled in **External Interaction Pack**: along with SSRF (12.6.1), test RFI. Actually 12.6.1 SSRF includes remote file fetch, so there's overlap. Test them together – any param that might call out, test internal (SSRF) and external (RFI) addresses.","- **OWASP WSTG** – Also covered in File Include testing (trying to include external URLs):contentReference[oaicite:143]{index=143}.
- **PHP Security** – RFI was common in older PHP apps; modern configs disable it by default, but custom code might still fetch remote content unsafely.","Primarily for applications in languages that can include remote files (PHP with allow_url_include on, maybe some templating engines that fetch remote templates). If the app doesn't have any functionality that accepts URLs from user, N/A. Also, if environment disables remote includes (which modern PHP does by default), the risk is lower, but the code could still attempt it, so still a bug in code if present (just mitigated by config).","https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/latest/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/05-Authorization_Testing/01-Testing_Directory_Traversal_File_Include","","2","FALSE",""
"File Handling (v12)","General","Reflective File Download","FALSE","","","","12.3.4","The application should not be vulnerable to Reflected File Download (RFD). RFD is a technique where an attacker crafts a link that causes the server to reflect user input in a downloadable file, tricking the user into running malicious content thinking it’s trustworthy. For example, the server might return content with a `Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=""...""` header including user-supplied data that can be turned into a .bat file or similar. We need to ensure that downloadable file content or names cannot be manipulated to execute code on the client side.","Manual steps: Identify any functionality where the app generates a downloadable file based on user input. Common case: export to CSV/Excel of user data with some parameters (like date range or name included in file). Or perhaps a debug endpoint that dumps data given a parameter.; Test if you can control the file name or file contents via parameters. For file name: see if any parameter is reflected in the `Content-Disposition` header or suggested filename. If yes, try adding an extension like `.html` or `.bat` in that parameter to see if the downloaded file has that extension (e.g., `reportName=evil.bat`). If it does, the user might double-click thinking it's data but it's actually an executable or script.; Test content: if any user input is included inside the file, can you inject a script or command? For example, if the app creates a .csv containing some user-supplied fields, put a payload that could execute in context (like formulas in Excel can execute commands - CSV injection). Or .bat commands if the file could be renamed .bat. Tools: Burp, Twingate blog example code Combo: Relates to **Content Injection Pack**: along with testing XSS and content reflections, consider file downloads as an attack surface. E.g., test CSV injection (if generating spreadsheets) which is a subset of RFD concept (not exactly RFD but similar user end exploitation).","- **Reflected File Download Whitepaper** – Oren Hafif's research outlines how an attacker can inject payload into a file download:contentReference[oaicite:145]{index=145}:contentReference[oaicite:146]{index=146}.
- **OWASP Top 10 (A8:2017-Insecure Deserialization)** – Though RFD is more social engineering, it's akin to forcing file execution on client side. Some references categorize it separately.","Only applicable if the app generates downloadable files using user input. If not, then N/A. It's fairly specific: many apps have some report or export feature though. JSONP endpoints (if any) also should be considered because those can be abused to deliver a 'file'.

"File Handling (v12)","General","OS-level Command Injection Through File Upload (e.g. in file name)","FALSE","","","","12.3.5","The file upload functionality must not allow OS command injection via file metadata (like file name) or processing. E.g., if the server uses the file name in a system call (like calling ImageMagick convert or a shell script), an attacker could craft a malicious file name such as `image.jpg; rm -rf /`. If not properly handled, the server might execute that trailing command. Essentially, the app should safely handle file names and not pass them unsanitized to OS shell commands.","Manual steps: Try uploading a file with a suspicious name: e.g., `test$(whoami).txt` or `test;uname -a`. Many servers will sanitize or flat-out reject special characters. See how the app handles it – if it renames the file (good) or allows it unchanged (hmm). Then see if any outcome occurs (the attack might not be obvious from outside – no direct feedback, unless you can see files saved).; Monitor application behavior after such upload. If there's any processing (like generating thumbnails), check if any anomalies occur (like error messages or strange delays). Possibly watch server logs if available for command injection signs.; If the file is accessible by download, check the stored name. Did it keep the weird characters? If yes, the risk is higher that somewhere an unsanitized usage could happen (especially if combined into a shell command). If it normalized the name (removed or replaced special chars), that’s safer. Tools: Burp (upload field tampering), Exiftool for payload injection Combo: Often part of **Injection Pack**: beyond SQL and XSS, test command injection in any file operations. The classic being file name injection in system calls. If there's an admin function to scan or decompress the file, also think about injection via those parameters.","- **OWASP Cheat Sheet** – 'Filename Safety' and general injection prevention:contentReference[oaicite:147]{index=147}:contentReference[oaicite:148]{index=148} (recommend not using dangerous chars in filenames, etc.).
- **ImageMagick ""ImageTragick"" CVE-2016-3714** – Example where image file name with special pipe characters led to command execution by convert utility.","If the app handles file names or passes file inputs to system calls. Not all do. If file uploads are just stored and not further processed by OS commands, direct injection risk is lower (though maybe still a risk if used in logs or something). But any image processing, PDF conversion, antivirus scanning could be avenues. So if upload feature exists, test a bit regardless, but especially if any processing is known.","https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/File_Upload_Cheat_Sheet.html; https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/OS_Command_Injection","","2","FALSE",""

For instance, uploading a webshell script (.php, .jsp, etc.) into a directory where it can be accessed and run. Proper file type validation (from 12.2.1) and storing files outside web root or without execute permissions (12.4.1) are key defenses. If those fail, an attacker could upload a malicious file and then directly navigate to it to run commands on the server.","Manual steps: Try uploading a known server-side script: if the app is on PHP, upload a `.php` file with simple PHP code (`<?php echo 'RCE'; ?>`). If on Java, maybe a `.jsp` or `.jspx` if allowed. If on .NET, `.aspx` or `.ashx`, etc. Many frameworks won't accept these or will rename them, but test it.; If upload appears successful, attempt to access the file via the URL it would have (if you can guess it or if the app gives you a link). For example, if images normally accessible at `uploads/<filename>`, try `uploads/yourfile.php`. See if your 'RCE' string or whatever code output appears, indicating the code executed.; If you can't directly access but suspect it's in web root, perhaps use a minor side effect in code: like a PHP file that writes to a known location or triggers a time delay (not ideal in black box). It's easier when you can access it via URL. Tools: Burp Repeater & Proxy, Automated shell upload (commonly in metasploit or others) Combo: This is basically the culmination of failing prior controls (type check, storage in web root). So it ties with category checks V12.2.1 and V12.4.1. If those are in place, this likely cannot happen. We test it anyway to confirm no gap. It's the ultimate **Web Shell Upload Pack** – try to upload and run a shell.","- **OWASP Top 10** – Code execution via file upload is a common critical issue (fits under A6 Security Misconfig or A10 older injection category).

If the app only stores files as data and definitely not reachable via web (or on a separate storage server that isn't executable), then it's not applicable. But always verify assumptions – e.g., just because devs say 'uploads not in web root', check if truly inaccessible (maybe direct URL might still fetch it).
